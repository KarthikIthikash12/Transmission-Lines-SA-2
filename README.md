## 📡 Introduction

If you've ever wondered how Starlink dishes connect to satellites zooming through space, the answer lies in **how electromagnetic (EM) waves travel**. This guide breaks down the technical theory behind it in a way that anyone can understand.

---

## 🕰️ History of Starlink

- **2015**: SpaceX files initial regulatory paperwork for satellite internet.
- **2018**: First two test satellites, Tintin A and B, launched.
- **2019**: First batch of 60 operational satellites launched into Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
- **2020-Present**: Expansion to thousands of satellites, beta testing, and global user coverage.

Starlink was created to provide **high-speed, low-latency internet** to underserved areas, especially rural and remote regions where fiber or cable isn't feasible.

## 🚀 Starlink System Overview

- **Satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)**
- **User terminals (Starlink dishes)** with **flat antennas**
- **Ground stations** that connect to the broader internet
- **Inter-satellite links** that allow satellites to talk to each other

All of this relies on **electromagnetic wave technology** — from the dish to the satellite and back.

## ⚡ How Electromagnetic Waves Work in Starlink

### 1. What are Electromagnetic Waves?

- They are waves made of electric and magnetic fields.
- These fields vibrate at 90 degrees to each other.
- EM waves include **radio waves**, **microwaves**, **light**, and more.
- Starlink uses **microwaves** to carry internet signals.

---

### 2. TEM, TE, and TM Waves Explained Simply

| Wave Type | What It Means | Where Starlink Uses It |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **TEM** (Transverse Electromagnetic) | Both electric and magnetic fields are fully sideways (perpendicular to the direction of travel). | Used in simple cables on the circuit board. |
| **TE** (Transverse Electric) | Electric field is sideways; magnetic field can point in any direction. | Used in rectangular waveguides in Starlink’s RF systems. |
| **TM** (Transverse Magnetic) | Magnetic field is sideways; electric field can point in any direction. | Found in resonators and filters. |

---

### 3. TE and TM Waves Between Metal Plates

- Imagine two metal plates and a wave moving between them.
- The wave bounces between the plates, forming patterns.
- These patterns are used to understand how real waveguides behave.

---

### 4. How Signals Travel Inside Starlink Devices (Rectangular Waveguides)

- Inside devices, signals travel in metal tubes called **waveguides**.
- These waveguides guide the wave in specific modes, like **TE10**.
- This ensures high-speed signals can move with minimal loss.

---

### 5. Circular Waveguides and Bessel Functions

- Starlink also uses circular tubes (waveguides).
- Math called **Bessel functions** describe how waves behave inside.
- These are used in feed horns — the small cone-shaped antennas.

---

### 6. Circular Antennas and How Waves Behave Inside Them

- Waves inside circular waveguides behave in special patterns.
- TM01 and TE11 are common patterns.
- These help control signal shape and strength.

---

### 7. Signal Boxes: Resonators

- Small metal boxes trap EM waves and make them resonate.
- Used in **filters** and **frequency control circuits**.
- Help ensure the signal stays clean and in the right frequency.

---

### 8. How the Dish Follows Satellites (Phased Arrays)

- Starlink dishes don’t move physically — they steer beams electronically.
- By changing the timing of wave signals across many small antennas, the dish can aim the signal in different directions.
- This lets it follow fast-moving satellites in real time.

| Concept | Hardware Component |
|--------|--------------------|
| TEM Waves | PCB and coaxial cables inside Starlink’s dish |
| TE10 Mode | Main mode used in rectangular waveguides in RF units |
| TM Modes | Found in filters and cavity resonators |
| Bessel Functions | Used in circular waveguides and feed horns |
| Resonators | Maintain clean signal and specific frequency |
| Phased Array | The flat dish that aims without moving |
| Cutoff Frequencies | Decide the waveguide size and signal type |
| Beam Steering | Tracks satellites in real time |
